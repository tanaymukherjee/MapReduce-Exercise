# MapReduce

## Doing the same example we did using grep and py shell

SQL is a langauge we use to query large databases and identify info based on some conditions.

It helps you put patterns and identify them for all conditions be it regex or not using 'LIKE' command.
This exercise is just a second alternative to solving the question we have already done ealier using mapper and reducer methods.

One can replicate it using Google Colabs or Repl.it
